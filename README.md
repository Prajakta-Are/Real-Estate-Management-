**🏢 Real Estate Business Intelligence & Analytics Solution**

**📌 Executive Summary**

This project delivers a comprehensive Business Intelligence solution for a real estate organization facing fragmented reporting, delayed decision-making, and limited visibility into performance drivers.
By designing a structured, executive-level dashboard ecosystem, this solution centralizes key performance indicators (KPIs), enhances pricing intelligence, improves operational transparency, and enables data-driven strategic decisions.

**🎯 Business Context**
